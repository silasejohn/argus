# League of Legends Tournament Analysis

This project aims to provide a toolset to analyze sign-up responses for VLN Draft S1. This should help our team captain prioritize potential players based on specific criteria such as role preference, rank, and champ pool. 

## Features
**Data Parsing**: Read and preprocess tournament sign-up data from a spreadsheet.
**Role Analysis**: Identify players' primary and secondary roles.
**Rank Evaluation**: Compare player ranks to create a skill-based priority list
**Custom Filters**: Filter and rank players based on user-defined criteria.
**Export Options**: Save prioritized lists for easy sharing.

## Getting Started

### Prereqs
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (install via `requirements.txt`)
    - `pandas`
    - `sys`

### Installation

    ```

2. Install dependencies: 
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Place the updated sign-up response spreadsheet (`data.csv`) in the data/ folder

### Usage
1. Run the format script to format the csv

Deactivate Virtual Environment: `deactivate`

#### TODO
1. look through raw spreadsheet + read qualitative descriptions ~> assign a bool value of "consideration"
2. look through primary / secondary rank descriptions ~> assign a bool value of "consider_secondary_role"
3. create selenium scripts for op.gg champ history, and rewind.lol to access more quantitative scouting info
4. COOL PRINT OUTPUT + DYNAMIC PRINT OUTPUT
5. TODO: change examples / test into pyunit or whatnot
6. Build Local React App ~> Live Draft Tool for Gepetto during Draft
7. Add Region Button Press for NA (when switching regions) handling incorrect input
8. Consider Friend Pools in draft picking
9. TAB the output for draft results
